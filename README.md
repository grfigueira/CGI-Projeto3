# Phong Lighting Simulator

This **WebGL** project allows users to explore the concept of [Phong lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model) in a simple 3D scene. 
The Phong lighting model is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to calculate the way that light reflects off of different surfaces, resulting in realistic-looking lighting and shading.

In this simulation, users can adjust the properties of the light sources (point light, directional light, spotlight) and the materials of the objects in the scene to see how they affect the overall lighting. 

#### This was a group project for the **Computer Graphics and Interfaces** class at FCT-UNL.

## Usage
We set up a Github Pages for this repository, so you can check out the result [here](https://grfigueira.github.io/CGI-Projeto3/)!

Alternitavely, you can clone the repository and open `index.html` with a Live Server. You can use [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) VSCode plugin to do so.
